# Basic Typescript Repo For Personal Projects

I love create-react-app, but it's always a little annoying to have to setup eslint and prettier each time.  This is just a boiler plate repo that has a few things setup already for my personal projects.

- typescript support
- eslint 
- prettier setup

1. Download repo:
```
git clone git@github.com:ladyshaitan/typescript-eslint-prettier-project.git
```

2. Install deps 
```
npm install
```

3. Start the app
```
npm run start
```

4. Make a bundle
```
npm run build
```
